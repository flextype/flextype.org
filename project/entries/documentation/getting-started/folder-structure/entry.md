<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] src</li>
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] vendor</li>
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] project</li>
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] var</li>
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] tests</li>
</ul>

The main folder of the Flextype system is `src/flextype/` which stores common and important files for its work.  
You cannot edit any files in this folder!

<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] src</li>
    <li class="file-list-level-2">[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] flextype</li>
</ul>

The `vendor/` folder contains important libraries that Flextype uses.  
This folder is similar to the flextype folder and its contents should not be edited!

<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] vendor</li>
</ul>

The `project/` folder should contains entries, uploads, tokens, plugins, themes and all that is necessary for the work of the project.

<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] project</li>
</ul>

The `var/` folder is used to store temporary cached files that are automatically created by the Flextype to improve performance.

<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] var</li>
</ul>

The `tests/` folder contains unit tests for Flextype.  

<ul class="file-list">
    <li>[icon name="folder" set="bootstrap"] tests</li>
</ul>
