##### Broken subpages

Your homepage is working, but subpages won't open or lead to a server error?

1. Make sure that the .htaccess file is present in your Flextype folder.
2. Check if `mod_rewrite` is enabled on your server.
3. Please try setting the `RewriteBase` in the .htaccess file:

```
RewriteBase /
```

If you run Flextype in a subfolder, make sure to set the RewriteBase according to the name of your subfolder:

```
RewriteBase /my-subfolder/
```
