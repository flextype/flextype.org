### BREAKING CHANGES

* **core:** core decoupled in the plugins, and moved out of the Flextype release package!

    Install all needed plugins for your project by your self.
    Browse plugins: https://github.com/flextype-plugins

* **core:** new way for data merging of manifest and settings for plugins and themes #404

    for e.g. this is a wrong code to access site title:
    ```
    {{ registry.plugins.site.title|e('html') }}
    ```

    and this is a correct code to access site title:
    ```
    {{ registry.get('plugins.site.settings.title')|e('html') }}
    ```
* **core:** We should add app `url` into the core instead of `base_url` and `site_url` #405

    for e.g. this is a wrong code to access site url:
    ```
    {{ registry.plugins.site.url }}
    ```

    and this is a correct code to access app url:
    ```
    {{ registry.get('flextype.settings.url') }}
    ```

* **core:** new `project` folder instead of `site`

    - rename folder `site` into `project`
    - use new constant PATH['project'] instead of constant PATH['site']

* **core:** removed constants

    - PATH['plugins']
    - PATH['themes']
    - PATH['entries']
    - PATH['themes']
    - PATH['snippets']
    - PATH['fieldsets']
    - PATH['tokens']
    - PATH['accounts']
    - PATH['uploads']
