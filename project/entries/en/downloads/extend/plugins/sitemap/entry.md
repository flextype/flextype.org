| default.priority | 1 | The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

#### Ignore entry(entries)

You can ignore your specific entries by providing a list of slug's to ignore.

```yaml
ignore:
  - blog/blog-post-to-ignore
  - ignore-this-entry
```

You can also use a entry Frontmatter to signal that the sitemap should ignore it:
```yaml
sitemap:
  ignore: true
```

#### Set default values for entry(entries)

```yaml
sitemap:
  changefreq: weekly
  priority: 0.8
```

#### Manually add entry(entries) to the sitemap

```yaml
additions:
  -
    loc: something-special
    lastmod: '2020-04-16'
    changefreq: hourly
    priority: 0.3
```

#### Dynamically adding entry(entries) to the sitemap

```php
flextype('emitter')->addListener('onSitemapAfterInitialized', function() {
    Flextype\Plugin\Sitemap\Controllers\SitemapController::$sitemap[] = ['loc' => 'something-special-to-add',
                                               'lastmod' => '03-07-2020 09:46',
                                               'changefreq' => 'daily',
                                               'priority' => 1.0];
});

```
