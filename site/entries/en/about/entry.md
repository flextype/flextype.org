<h3 class="h3">Introducing</h3>

<p>
Flextype was <strong>founded in March 2018</strong> as lightweight alternative to other heavy and outdated CMS. Many people use complex solutions for simple pages, unnecessarily. Building this content management system, we focused on simplicity - even novice webmaster adapt his template and writes his own plugin. To achieve this, we implemented a simple but powerful API's.
