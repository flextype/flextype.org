<p>Flextype allows you to configure your site in any way you can dream up, and itâ€™s thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that make this possible. Configuration files are written in YAML syntax with a .yaml file extension. YAML is a data serialisation language designed to be directly writable and readable by humans. You can check out this <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/">YAML help page</a> to get a complete understanding of the syntax available.</p>

<p>You can update and create site configuration by editing file <code>/site/config/settings.yaml</code></p>
