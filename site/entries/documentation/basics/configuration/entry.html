<p>Flextype allows you to configure your site in any way you can dream up, and it’s thanks to the powerful and flexible configuration options that make this possible. Configuration files are written in YAML syntax with a .yaml file extension. YAML is a data serialisation language designed to be directly writable and readable by humans. You can check out this <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/">YAML help page</a> to get a complete understanding of the syntax available.</p>

<p>You can update and create site configuration by editing file <code>/site/config/settings.yaml</code></p>
